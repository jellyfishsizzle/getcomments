## Find comments in web pages

While participating in CTFs it's a common occurrence to come across pages that have comments buried in the HTML.  Nothing is perfect (including this spaghetti code), but I wanted something that would at least do some of the heavy lifting.  

It's not another dirburster, it won't do the scanning for you.  I don't think there's a need to reinvent the wheel, but it's good to have another pair of "eyes" searching for sometimes elusive comments.  Besides, more enumeration is always better.

The script just requires the output of gobuster or ffuf (other cli scanners may also work). It will just output the comments themselves with out the `<!--`

### Usage:
```
# cat ffuf.out
# ffuf -c -e ".html,.php,.txt,/" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.138.175/FUZZ -t 75

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\

          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/
